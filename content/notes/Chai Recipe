A recipe from your local Gim instance. 

# Ingredients
- Milk
- Tea
- Water
- Sugar (Optional)
- Ginger (Optional)
- Cardamom/Elaichi (Optional)

All three of them are optional but recommended to have.

# Method

This is for making chai for two people
- Put the pan on the stove (Turn it on)
- Put two cups water into the pan
- Put three small-spoons of tea into the pan
- Wait for 15-30 seconds, until you see a black-ish colour
- Now put one cup of milk
- Wait for a 10-20 seconds, it should become slightly orange-ish
- (OPTIONAL) In the meanwhile, take your mortar and pestle and put your cardamom and ginger into it. Smash away and chuck it into the pan.
- Boil it two-three times. Three if it's a lot of chai. But since it's only two cups, two times should be fine.
- Strain it into cups \:)

If you want it to be sweet, put some sugar into it and swirl it around. If you can feel sugar stuck onto the bottom you haven't swirled it enough :v

Enjoy 😄
